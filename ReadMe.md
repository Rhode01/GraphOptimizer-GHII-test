## Description

The script takes a predefined set of nodes (districts with initial X/Y positions) and edges (connections between districts) and runs a physics-based simulation to rearrange the nodes. 
The goal is to produce a visually clear layout where connected districts are close, all districts are spaced out to avoid overlap, and the overall geographic orientation of the map is preserved.

The final, optimized `(X, Y)` coordinates for each district are printed to the console.
